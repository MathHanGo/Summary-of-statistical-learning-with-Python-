    "# Linear regression summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a method to predict quantitative response on the basis of a single predictor or multiple predictors by holding the assumption of a linear relationship between response and predictors. For each predictor, we give a coefficient to describe its weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we only have one predictor ${\\bf x}$ and the response ${\\bf y}$. Then the linear relationship between them can be formed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf y} := \\beta_0 + \\beta_1{\\bf x}$ ( We give a weight $\\beta_1$ for ${\\bf x}$ to describe how ${\\bf x}$ close to ${\\bf y}$. Obvioulsy, if ${\\bf x}=0$, then ${\\bf y} = \\beta_0$, ${\\bf x}$ have no relationship with ${\\bf y}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our purpose is to predict ${\\bf y}$ if we give a ${\\bf x}$. Thus, the first task is to estimate unknown coefficient $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. Once we got the estimates $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$, the prediction of ${\\bf y}$ can be computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{\\bf y} = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1{\\bf x}$"
